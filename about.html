            <div class="aboutme">My name is Laila Mariel R. Enarne, a 20-year-old second-year student pursuing a
                Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at West Visayas State University, Lambunao Campus.
                I consider myself a cheerful and optimistic individual with a strong interest in the 
                intersection of technology and creativity. <br> <br>
                Although I do not consider myself inherently “creative”, I have a deep appreciation for the
                arts and artistic expressions. I find great joy in engaging with creative, aesthetic, and
                artistic works, and I have developed a passion for incorporating this love for design into 
                my technical projects. <br> <br>
                This website showcases my creations within platform technologies, where I combine my technical 
                expertise in information technology with my enthusiasm for design and creativity. Each project
                is developed with dedication, attention to detail, and a genuine love for creating meaningful,
                functional, and aesthetically pleasing solutions.
